  "content" 	: "<p>There are few things as highly anticipated as the next season of Netflix’s Stranger Things. Ever since we finished binge-watching the show last summer, we’ve been left with all sorts of lingering questions. What happened to Eleven? What’s that thing that Will is coughing up? The first teaser trailer for the show’s second season aired during the Super Bowl, and we also now have a release date: Halloween.</p><p>The teaser shows off a reverence for all things nostalgia (Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Ghostbusters references, anyone?), and shows off glimpses of the gang, Eleven, Hop, and something very scary in the sky.</p><p>There’s not much that we know about season 2: just that it takes place a year later, and that the town will largely deal with the fallout from the events that transpired in the first season. Hopefully, the season will meet our sky-high expectations.</p><p>Stranger Things, season 2 will begin streaming on October 31st, 2017.</p><br/><br/><iframe width='100%' height='420' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Egf5U8xLo8'></iframe>",
